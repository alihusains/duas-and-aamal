This policy is designed to inform users about our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information, particularly in the context of remembering and reciting prayers for deceased loved ones. By using our Service, you agree to the collection and use of information as outlined in this policy.

Information Collection and Use

In addition to providing and improving the Service, we may collect information about deceased loved ones for remembrance and recitation of prayers, such as Surah Al-Fatiha. This information is used solely for the purpose of honoring and remembering the deceased and will not be shared with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

For a better user experience, we may request certain permissions, including location and file storage. Any information we collect is retained on your device and is not accessed or collected by us in any way, except as explicitly stated in this policy. The app may utilize third-party services that collect information for identification purposes.

Location Data

We utilize location services solely to provide accurate prayer timings and Hijri dates based on your geographical location. We do not use location data for any other purpose.

Links to Other Sites

While our Service may contain links to third-party sites, please note that we do not operate these external sites. We advise you to review the Privacy Policies of any third-party websites you visit, as we do not have control over their content or practices.

If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will promptly delete it from our servers. Parents or guardians who believe their child has provided us with personal information should contact us so that appropriate action can be taken.
